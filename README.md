# SortingAlgorithms
Java application which benchmarks different sorting algorithms, rating them against one another in terms of Big-O time complexity.
Algorithms displayed are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort and Counting Sort.
Array of random numbers, of different sizes are generated using math.random, and the average time taken for each of the sorting algorithms to sort these arrays is calculated.
The results are then printed in table format.

**Prerequisites**  
Java 8 or higher

**How to run**  
Download and compile repository and run in Eclipse IDE.  
Run the Runner.java file.  
Results will be printed in table format.
